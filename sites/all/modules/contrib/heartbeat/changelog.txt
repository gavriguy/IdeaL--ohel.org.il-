# @date 10/05/2010 For release DRUPAL-6--4-10
---------------------------------------------------------------
- Refactoring to improve perfomance
  * Changed the order of execution of the heartbeat_load hook.
  * Cached the friends of a user with a static variable.
  * Changed the node_access checks to a better way (Swentel):
    Added fields nid_info and nid_target_info to fasten the node_access.
  * Cached get_latest_shout message in a static variable.
  * Added a field for comment count 
  * Altered the comment count calculation for node comments
  * Made sure no extra queries were run due to "comment_count = 0".
  * Cached the message entry output on activity row base(html output)
    cleared when actions occur that involve this activity.

# @date 10/05/2010 For release DRUPAL-6--4-9
---------------------------------------------------------------
- Security Update!
  When shouts are displayed, the content is now sanitized with filter_xss
  to filter the user input.
  Actions:
    - Upgraded heartbeat.install so the default allowed tags are more secure.
    There is a left-over img attack but the code where this filtering is done,
    is managed by a higher level permission. Before heartbeat messages,
    heartbeat comments (and shouts) were sanitized with this tags match. It is 
    only needed and handy for the per UI manipulatable heartbeat messages. This 
    means that heartbeat comments and shouts will follow the normal filter_xss 
    approach within standard drupal.
    - Added the filter_xss for shouts module when fetching the shouts from database
    - Tipped by David Rothstein, I moved the filter_xss for heartbeat_messages to a 
    earlier point so it's not theme-overriable (thus possibly leading to XSS attack)
- Change to hds_regions.css following the DS releases.
- Added basic features integration.
- Fixed a couple of issues from the d.o queue.
- Refactored the comment rules integration so it can take the original author as well.
- Added update hook for this install.
  
---------------------------------------------------------------
# @date 19/04/2010 For release DRUPAL-6--4-8
---------------------------------------------------------------
- bugfixes and feature request from issuequeue.

---------------------------------------------------------------
# @date 17/05/2010 For release DRUPAL-6--4-7
---------------------------------------------------------------
- bugfixes and feature request from issuequeue.

---------------------------------------------------------------
# @date 14/04/2010 For release DRUPAL-6--4-6
---------------------------------------------------------------
- moved connectedheartbeat to friendlist_activity module where it 
  belongs.
- fixed some bugs
- Added throbber to ajax loads
- improved views integration module
- Added some examples and documentation on heartbeat.menhireffect.be

---------------------------------------------------------------
# @date 14/03/2010 For release DRUPAL-6--4-6
---------------------------------------------------------------
- Friendlist_activity module will now take three user relations defining modules
  as api to make a choice on what defines heartbeat user relations. 
- Cleared d.o. issues and support request untill satisfied.



---------------------------------------------------------------
# @date 11/02/2010
---------------------------------------------------------------
- Refactored hds to follow releases of display suite
- Added check box on the stream configuration page so we can choose
  to have filters on block and/or page in stead of always enabled at once.
- Fixed some issue on d.o
- Fixed a bug on the page pager setting. 

---------------------------------------------------------------
# @date 01/02/2010
---------------------------------------------------------------
- Improved and added tests

---------------------------------------------------------------
# @date 31/01/2010
---------------------------------------------------------------
- Updated hds to be compatible with updated DS module
- Removed all notices and warnings from the postings(shouts, comments)
- Added a shout rules data type, so custom shout tokens can be used. With this
  change, rules export files are renewed.


---------------------------------------------------------------
# @date 28/01/2010
---------------------------------------------------------------
- Changed friendlist_activity to take options to define which user relation 
  api will be used.
- Debug and fixround through the issue queue on drupal.org
- Updated views integration back to normal
- Improved scalability of a stream bigtime by adding a variable to maximize
  the sql. This is a rather weird configuration as it takes a little of playing
  with numbers.


---------------------------------------------------------------
# @date 2/12/2009
---------------------------------------------------------------
- Changed HeartbeatActivity object to hold a HeartbeatMessageTemplate
  object as composition. This way the objects live separately as it should.
- Altered and added defaults to HDS module.
- Added a heartbeat_examples module to show developers what can be achieved 
  by implementing hooks, overriding methods and classes.

---------------------------------------------------------------
# @date 27/11/2009
---------------------------------------------------------------
- Moved heartbeat rules to modules as submodule. As heartbeat is an API
  users are free to use it with custom code or install directly to let it 
  work with UI only (with hrules enabled).
- Added submodule hds as implementation of Display suite. We use it a lot 
  at work and heartbeat could benefit from it, putting the theming to 
  UI as well. again users are free to override theme functions with code,
  implement the hook_heartbeat_theme_alter function or using hrules submodule
  to theme their activity objects to the stream.


---------------------------------------------------------------
# @date 09/11/2009
---------------------------------------------------------------
- Added poll for more messages
- Altered the theme_heartbeat_filters function. So take care if you 
  were overriding this function!!!
- Changed (removed) the autoload function to speed up and handle 
  class instances differently. Creating a stream should go with the 
  function "heartbeat_stream_view" from now on.
  
---------------------------------------------------------------
# @date 20/10/2009
---------------------------------------------------------------
- Added heartbeat filters hook with callback to decrement the messages.
- Changed shout to a full commenting/reactions module to add a comment
  form on messages or commenting the nodes in the messages.

---------------------------------------------------------------
# @date 26/09/2009
---------------------------------------------------------------
- Added nid_target and changed nid_target into nid (for normal node contexts)
  nid_target can be used for instance for og.
  
  
---------------------------------------------------------------
# @date 26/07/2009
---------------------------------------------------------------
- Changed functionality so messages are fetched by number of records and not by timestamp. 
- Added pager property to info so the messagebuilder knows more on how it should display things.
- Added a per-message  property to overrule the maximum number of messages to merge together. The 
  global setting is overruled if the message specific one is set. For instance, when uploading images, 
  layout-wise we want to show 5 images in the summary. But if pages are the context of activity, then i 
  will only show 3 of them.
- TODO Make the pager ajax compatible and add settings for each access type

---------------------------------------------------------------
# @date 23/07/2009
---------------------------------------------------------------
- Changed activity stream settings so we can set max items separately per 
  heartbeat access type.
  
---------------------------------------------------------------
# @date 22/07/2009
---------------------------------------------------------------
- Changed some code on message attachments so it can work more generic
- Posted new picture and plan to recreate some blog posts, maybe roadmap
- Added commenting to the attachments via shouts module. You can shout globally 
  or you could react with a shout on a message user activity stream id.
- Added a field to the messages that is very important to always have the merging 
  go correct. If we know the message part that has to be summarized and now we 
  know the variable in the message that is used to group by, we can always group 
  messages together without having problems on actor vs logged-in user shit. 
  This is difficult to explain in detail.

---------------------------------------------------------------
# @date 20/07/2009
---------------------------------------------------------------
- FEATURE: Added heartbeat message tags as a comma separated list of values
  we can use to filter our activity streams on. This will be available in views as well, 
  but mainly a default tagged page display will be provided as well within heartbeat
- Removed the code for module and message_type because has become unneccesairy with the introduction
  of tags. They were only there to use in views to limit specific contained messages (E.g. friendlist stuff)
  Now all of this is available with displays on a tag basis.
  
---------------------------------------------------------------
# @date 19/07/2009
---------------------------------------------------------------
- Rechecked and changed the default message exports to work with the current format. (issue queue)
- Deleted the columns module and type from the list overview. 
- Added revert option on heartbeat messages, such as in rules. This way default messages
  can be altered but put back to codebase (after export for instance) easily.
- FEATURE: Added logic to the heartbeatmessagebuilder to check the access that is now introduced on 
  a per heartbeat-message base. This is an global setting that leads or has higher priority 
  in comparison to the heartbeatAccessState the messages are built with.
  E.g. Lists composed with PublicHeartbeatAccess State object can hide/display message types 
  as they were set in the message configuration.

---------------------------------------------------------------
# @date 13/07/2009
---------------------------------------------------------------
- FEATURE: Added integration in heartbeat messages to have flags, using the submodule "flag_heartbeat". Two things that have to 
  be done here: 1/ change the way the heartbeat message edit form is altered. 2/ Delete the flag property and change this
  POC to a real concept with attachments per message. Flags would be an attachment, but others will come, like comments...
- added a custom field to db heartbeat_messages to know how a message was installed/added

---------------------------------------------------------------
# @date 13/06/2009
# Changed features from 6.3 to 6.4
---------------------------------------------------------------
- BUGFIX: Added node_type (if available) to the logic of merging messages
- removed the heartbeat-flag code because i intend to integrate with the nice module "flag"
- Deleted unused variables and even used ones that did not have much purpose anymore
- Moved heartbeat states to separate files, making it possible to use a custom heartbeat state 
  in contributes modules
- Removed the menu items in the navigation. (This should not be done by heartbeat by default imho)
- removed module heartbeat_activity and added codebase to heartbeat because it did not make sense to separate 
  them if you can cant use one as standalone module
