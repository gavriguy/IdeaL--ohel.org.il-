With this module enabled, a user who attempts to change the email address associated with their account must confirm that change by clicking a confirmation link that is sent to the new email address. The confirmation link must be clicked with a certain time period after which the pending update to their email address will expire and they will have to attempt to update their account again. This module was based on code from <a href=\"!url\">this issue</a></p>"
