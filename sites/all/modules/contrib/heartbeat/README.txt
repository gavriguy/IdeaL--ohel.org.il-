-- NOTES --

- As of DRUPAL-6-4x, heartbeat is stable and will not immediately change a lot in
  message storage and database storage. Upgrade path should be easier now.
  
- The difference between branches is too big to change versions easily.
  The features added needed too much refactoring that core functionality AND db
  fields needed to change.
  If you plan to do so, please unstall heartbeat completely and reinstall the module.
