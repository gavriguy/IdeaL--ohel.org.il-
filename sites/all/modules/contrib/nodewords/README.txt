This module allows you to set some meta tags for the different resources exposed
by your site: nodes, users, views, taxonomy filters and error pages are some
examples.

Giving more attention to the important keywords and/or description on your site
allows you to get better search engine positioning (given that you really only
provide the keywords which exist in the content itself, and do not try to lie).

This version of the module only works with Drupal 6.x.

Features
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a brief of features provided by this module:

* You can separately specify the meta tags to show on some specific pages of
  your site (the error 403 page, the error 404 page), or to use in specific
  situations (the pages with a pager, i.e.).

* A pluggable system allow the inclusion of new meta tags apart from the ones
  provided by this module.

* The current supported basic meta tags are ABSTRACT, CANONICAL, COPYRIGHT,
  GEO.POSITION, DESCRIPTION, ICBM, KEYWORDS, PICS-LABEL, REVISIT-AFTER, ROBOTS.
  These meta tags are provided by the module Basic meta tags.

* Additionally, you may include site verification meta tags used by external
  sources: Google Webmaster Tools, Microsoft Bing Webmaster Center, Yahoo! Site
  Explorer.
  These meta tags are provided by the module Site verification meta tags.

* Additionally you may include the Dublin Core meta tag schema.
  These meta tags are provided by the module Extra meta tags.

* You can select which of the available tags will be available for edition, and
  which will be exposed in the HTML of your site.

* You can specify a default meta tag ROBOTS value used for all pages, but easily
  override it for every page.

Installing Nodewords (aka Meta tags) (first time installation)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Backup your database.

2. Copy the module as normal.
   More information about installing contributed modules could be found at
   "Install contributed modules" [1].

3. Enable the "Nodewords" module from the module administration page
   (Administer >> Site configuration >> Modules).

4. Configure the module (see "Configuration" below).

5. You should enable other modules providing meta tags. There are three modules
   implementing meta tags:
   - Basic meta tags: for typical DESCRIPTION, ABSTRACT, COPYRIGHT meta tags.
   - Extra meta tags: for Dublin meta tag Schema.
   - Site verification meta tags: for specific API meta tags by search engines.

Updating Nodewords (aka Meta tags) (module version upgrade)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Verify that the version you are going to upgrade contains all the features
   your are using in your Drupal setup. Some features could have been removed
   or replaced by others.

2. Read carefully in the project issue tracking about upgrade paths problems
   before you start the upgrade process. Some versions don't support a clean
   upgrade path that may left your site meta tags unusable.

3. Backup your database.

4. Update current module code with latest recommended version. Previous versions
   could have bugs already reported and fixed in the last version.

5. Complete the update process, set maintenance mode, call the update.php script
   and finish the update operation. For more information please go to:
   http://groups.drupal.org/node/19513

6. Verify your module configuration and check that the features you are using
   work as expected. Also verify that all required modules are enabled, and
   permissions are set as desired.

Note: Whenever you have the chance, try an update in a local or development
      copy of your site.


Configuration
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. On the access control administration page ("Administer >> User management
   >> Access control") you need to assign:

   - the "administer meta tags" permission to the roles that are allowed to
     administer the meta tags (such as setting the default values and/or
     enabling the possibility to edit them),

2. On the settings page ("Administer >> Content management >> Nodewords") you
   can specify the default settings for the module. To access this page users
   need the "administer meta tags" permission.

3. You should enable meta tags for editing before they are available for use.
   The same operation should be done for meta tag output. Only allowed Meta tags
   are available for editing or exposed in the HTML of your site.

   Other settings are available for the generation of meta tags in the same
   page.


Related modules
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Starting from nodewords-5.x-1.9 the following modules extend the nodewords
functionality:

- Meta tags Node Type, by Ariel Barreiro
- Meta Tags by Path, by Shannon Lucas

The latest development snapshot (6.x-1.x-dev), and version 6.x-1.1 or higher
implement a functionality similar to the one implemented in the module
Meta Tags by Path, which is not anymore required for those versions.

To assure compatibility between Nodewords and Meta tags Node Type, use the
latest version available of Nodewords and Meta tags Node Type; previous versions
were not compatible with the recent changes in Nodewords.
