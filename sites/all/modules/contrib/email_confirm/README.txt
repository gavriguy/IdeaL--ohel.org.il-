Module description
==================

This module was created to address a missing piece of 
functionality in the Drupal user system.

Currently if a user updates their email address there 
is no confirmation step to ensure that the new email 
address belongs to the user and is able to receive email. 

In researching this issue I came across a patch to Drupal
core to address this issue. The patch is still pending 
however so I wrote this module borrowing from the code
submitted as patches in this issue.

See http://drupal.org/node/85494 for more information

This module uses hook_user to intercept when a user is
updating their user account. If the email address is
being changed then two emails are generated and sent
to both the user's original email address and their new
email address. The user must click a confirmation link
in the email sent to their new email address in order
for the change in their account email address to be
confirmed. The link in the confirmation email expires
after 24 hours.

Installation and Configuration
==============================

1) Copy the Email Change Confirmation module files to your
   Drupal modules directory (e.g. /sites/all/modules)

2) To install, enable the Email Change Confirmation module
   on the Drupal modules page /admin/build/modules

3) Go to /admin/settings/email_confirm to configure the 
   settings for the emails sent out to users when they
   change their email address.

  a) The site administrator can configure the email Subject,
     From email address, BCC email address (if desired) and 
     the body of the emails sent to both the user's original
     email address and to the new email address they wish to
     change to.

Notes
=====

If an email address is changed by a user that has the 
'administer users' permission, the email confirmation
email is not sent out and the change to the user's
information is effective immediately.

Hooks
=====

The Email Change Confirmation module implements a hook to
allow other modules to take action when a user requests to
change their email address and/or confirms the change of
their email address.

To implement the hook, create a function that ends 
in _email_confirm:

MODULENAME_email_confirm($op, $uid, $old_mail, $new_mail) {
  // Do something here
}

The $op will be either 'email change' when a user edits their
account and changes their email address or 'email confirmation'
when the user clicks the confirmation link in the email sent
out by this module after the user attempts to change their
email address. 

The $uid is the user ID of the user changing their email
address.

$old_mail and $new_mail are the user's original email address
and the email address they wish to change to.
